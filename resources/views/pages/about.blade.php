                I'm a full-stack Software Developer living outside Denver, Colorado üèî.
                I love writing Ruby on Rails applications and currently work remotely for <a
                    href="https://www.podia.com" class="text-link" target="_blank">Podia</a> as a Senior Product
                Developer.
                I've been programming Ruby on Rails apps personally since 2014 and professionally since 2016.

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-8 mb-4">
                For as long as I can remember, I've always been fascinated with computers. I remember playing with the
                computers we had growing up, and I'd take them apart and put them back together. It was so cool to be
                able
                take pieces from one computer and put them in another to get more storage space.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-8 mb-4">
                Over my middle school and high school years I was absolutely smitten with HTML and CSS. I'd go on to use
                it
                to build small websites and during that time I had an absolute blast and fell in love. I'd spend a few
                years
                attempting to learn PHP, but it never felt right.

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-8 mb-4">
                Then, one day in 2012 a friend showed me Ruby and Sinatra. They struggled through teaching me, and we
                managed to teach me just enough to make the first version of this website (my portfolio!). It was enough
                to
                spark something inside of me. I absolutely loved the readability and simplicity of Ruby.

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-8 mb-4">
                I found Ruby on Rails in early 2014, and things started clicking. It took me around 2 years to feel
                comfortable enough with where I was at knowledge wise to apply for my first job... and I got it! I
                started
                coding at work in 2016 and since then I've loved every day of coding since.

                In April 2019 I started as a Product Developer for <a href="https://www.podia.com" target="_blank"
                    class="text-link">Podia</a>. and I have enjoyed every single minute of it. I get to spend my
                time
                building software that helps empower Creators to build a living doing what they love. Not only that, but
                living the remote life allowed me to follow my dreams and move to a state I've wanted to call home
                (Colorado!).

                Early in 2020 I released by first course: <a href="https://store.afomera.dev" target="_blank"
                    class="text-link">Learn Rails by Building Instagram</a>, which I hope is the first of many
                courses
                I make to help give back to the community to learn from.
